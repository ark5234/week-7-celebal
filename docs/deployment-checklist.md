  - Choose main branch
  - Set main file path (usually `app.py`)
  - Click "Deploy!"

- [ ] **Monitor deployment**
  - Watch build logs for errors
  - Fix any dependency issues
  - Verify app loads correctly

### Step 3: Alternative Deployment (Heroku)
If you prefer Heroku deployment:

- [ ] **Create additional files for Heroku**
  
  **setup.sh**:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/.streamlit/
  
  echo "\
  [server]\n\
  headless = true\n\
  port = $PORT\n\
  enableCORS = false\n\
  \n\
  " > ~/.streamlit/config.toml
  ```
  
  **Procfile**:
  ```
  web: sh setup.sh && streamlit run app.py
  ```

- [ ] **Deploy to Heroku**
  - Create Heroku app
  - Connect to GitHub
  - Enable automatic deploys
  - Deploy branch

## Post-Deployment Checklist

## 🚨 Common Deployment Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Dependencies not installing
**Solution:** 
- Check `requirements.txt` has exact versions
- Remove unnecessary packages
- Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to capture current environment

### Issue: App won't start
**Solution:**
- Check file paths are relative, not absolute
- Ensure main file is named correctly
- Verify all imports are available

### Issue: Model not loading
**Solution:**
- Ensure model file is in repository (if < 100MB)
- Use relative paths for model loading
- Check model was saved with same library versions

### Issue: App running slowly
**Solution:**
- Use `@st.cache_data` for data loading
- Optimize visualizations
- Reduce model complexity if needed

### Issue: Styling problems
**Solution:**
- Test on different screen sizes
- Use Streamlit's responsive features
- Avoid hardcoded pixel values
